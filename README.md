Creating a password strength checker involves evaluating several factors to determine how strong a password is. The primary factors typically considered are:

1.Length: Longer passwords are generally stronger.
2.Complexity: Passwords that use a mix of different types of characters (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special symbols) are considered stronger.
3.Uniqueness: Passwords that are not easily guessable and do not use common words or patterns are more secure.
